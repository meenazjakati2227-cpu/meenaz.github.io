- **Teaching Philosophy:** Learning becomes powerful when it connects to the real world.”

I believe in a student-centred classroom where learners actively construct knowledge rather than passively receive it. My teaching approach integrates:

🌍 Real-world applications — Connecting coding and mathematics to everyday problem-solving
🤝 Collaborative learning — Encouraging teamwork, discussion, and peer exploration
🛠️ Hands-on STEM projects — Making concepts tangible through coding, simulation, and prototyping
